## About Me

Hi there! I am a first-year PhD student at the University of Edinburgh, funded by the [UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in Designing Responsible NLP](https://www.responsiblenlp.org). My research is focused on memory, uncertainty, and factuality in LLMs, under the supervision of [Alexandra Birch](https://sites.google.com/view/alexandra-birch/home) and [Bjorn Ross](https://sweb.inf.ed.ac.uk/bross3/). Here, I am a member of [ILCC](https://informatics.ed.ac.uk/ilcc), and the [statmt](https://www.wiki.ed.ac.uk/spaces/statmt/pages/394675357/People) and [SMASH](https://smash.inf.ed.ac.uk) research groups. Previously, I worked as a Junior NLP Engineer at [Aveni](https://aveni.ai), as a research assistant at the University of Edinburgh, and as a Site Reliability Engineer Intern at [Google Dublin](https://about.google/intl/ALL_ie/around-the-globe/local-info/). Before then, I completed a BSc (Hons) in Cognitive Science at the School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh.
